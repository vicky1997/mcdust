This version creates a directory for writing separate hdf5 files for every snapshot.(better than single file)
Erosion is a choice, you can give the name of your data directory.
Be careful this still overwrites data to an existing directory.
debugging files timestep.dat and mmax.dat can be written out with a switch.
