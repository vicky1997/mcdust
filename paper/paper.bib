This module is made available for public use with this paper. The coagulation model considers locally monodisperse dust size distributions around single values that are carried by the SPH particles. Along with the presentation of the model, implementation, and tests, we showcase growth and fragmentation in a few typical circumstellar disc simulations and revisit previous results. The module is also interfaced with the radiative transfer code mcfost, which facilitates the comparison between simulations and ALMA observations by generating synthetic maps. Circumstellar disc simulations with growth and fragmentation reproduce the ‘self-induced dust trap’ mechanism first proposed in 2017, which supports its existence. Synthetic images of discs featuring this mechanism suggest it would be detectable by ALMA as a bright axisymmetric ring at several tens of au from the star. With this paper, our aim is to provide a public tool to be able to study and explore dust growth in a variety of applications related to planet formation.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Current models of (exo)planet formation often rely on a large influx of so-called “pebbles” from the outer disk into the planet formation region. In this paper, we investigate how the formation/coagulation of pebbles in the cold outer regions of protoplanetary disks and their subsequent migration to the inner disk can alter the gas-phase CO distribution both interior and exterior to the midplane CO snowline. By simulating the resulting CO abundances in the midplane as well as the warm surface layer, we identify observable signatures of large-scale pebble formation and migration that can be used as “smoking guns” for this important process. Specifically, we find that after 1 Myr, the formation and settling of icy pebbles results in the removal of up to 80% of the CO vapor in the warm () disk layers outside the CO snowline, while the radial migration of pebbles results in the generation of a plume of CO vapor inside the snowline, increasing the CO abundance by a factor ∼2–6 depending on the strength of the turbulence and the sizes of the individual pebbles. The absence of this plume of CO vapor in young nearby disks could indicate efficient conversion of CO into a more refractory species, or to the radial mass flux of pebbles being drastically reduced by, for example, disk inhomogeneities or early planetesimal formation.}

    abstract = {Most protoplanetary discs are thought to undergo violent and frequent accretion outbursts, during which the accretion rate and central luminosity are elevated for several decades. This temporarily increases the disc temperature, leading to the sublimation of ice species as snowlines move outwards. In this paper, we investigate how an FUor-type accretion outburst alters the growth and appearance of dust aggregates at different locations in protoplanetary discs. We develop a model based on the Monte Carlo approach to simulate locally the coagulation and fragmentation of icy dust particles and investigate different designs for their structure and response to sublimation. Our main finding is that the evolution of dust grains located between the quiescent and outburst water snowlines is driven by significant changes in composition and porosity. The time required for the dust population to recover from the outburst and return to a coagulation/fragmentation equilibrium depends on the complex interplay of coagulation physics and outburst properties, and can take up to 4500 yr at 5 au. Pebble-sized particles, the building blocks of planetesimals, are either deprecated in water ice or completely destroyed, respectively, resulting in drier planetesimals or halting their formation altogether. When accretion outbursts are frequent events, the dust can be far from collisional equilibrium for a significant fraction of time, offering opportunities to track past outbursts in discs at millimetre wavelengths. Our results highlight the importance of including accretion outbursts in models of dust coagulation and planet formation.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {It is believed that satellites of giant planets form in circumplanetary disks (CPDs). Many of the previous contributions assumed that their formation process proceeds similarly to rocky planet formation via accretion of the satellite seeds called satellitesimals. However, the satellitesimal formation itself poses a nontrivial problem, as the dust evolution in CPD is heavily impacted by fast radial drift and thus dust growth to satellitesimals is hindered. To address this problem, we connected state-of-the art hydrodynamical simulations of a CPD around a Jupiter-mass planet with dust growth, and a drift model in a post-processing step. We found that there is an efficient pathway to satellitesimal formation if there is a dust trap forming within the disk. Thanks to natural existence of an outward gas-flow region in the hydrodynamical simulation, a significant dust trap arises at the radial distance of 85 RJ from the planet, where the dust-to-gas ratio becomes high enough to trigger streaming instability. The streaming instability leads to efficient formation of the satellite seeds. Because of the constant infall of material from the circumstellar disk and the very short timescale of dust evolution, the CPD acts as a satellitesimal factory, constantly processing the infalling dust to pebbles that gather in the dust trap and undergo the streaming instability.}
