## Installation

`git clone git@github.com:vicky1997/mcdust.git`

## Prerequisites

`gfortran` `hdf5-serial` `python`

To install the required software in Ubuntu(this requires root permissions):
`sudo apt-get install gfortran`
`sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev`

Python is not required to run the code. But if you want to use the routines to read/write data from the simulation you will need a python installation.

## To compile the code: 

`make SETUP_FILE=default`

This uses the setup files from the default run in `/setups/default/` 
The setup files can be modified to suit your needs and can be added to the `setups` directory. An executable in the name of the setup file will be created in the root directory which is `default` in this case.

parameter file: setups/default/setup.par

To run the unit tests:

`make test SETUP_FILE=tests`
## To run the code: 

`export OMP_NUM_THREADS=number_of_CPUs`

`./default /setups/default/setup.par`

To clear the run

`make clean SETUP_FILE=default`

## Unit tests
To run the unit tests in `unit_tests/testsuite.F90`

`make test SETUP_FILE=tests`

To clear the run

`make cleantest SETUP_FILE=tests`
